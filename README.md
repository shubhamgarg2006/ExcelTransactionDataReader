# ExcelTransactionDataReader

Hello! Thank you for viewing this project. The goal of this project was to create a transaction analysis script that could figure out the holdings of a portfolio at a given date. This is useful for our case, if we are using the Bloomberg terminal to track our portfolios historical positions. The final positions can then be used to conduct attribution analysis (learn about it here: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/attribution-analysis.asp).

This project was effectively vibe coded with the help of ChatGPT. I only take credit for developing the lying logic for this script.

The current best file to use is: excelReader.py
